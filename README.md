Graceful degradation aims to build web applications that are fully functional in modern environments, but still remain usable in older or less capable environments. If some features or functionalities are not supported by a user's circumstances, such as browser, device, or network, the core functionality of the application remains accessible. To this end, service workers align with the goals of graceful degradation, by ensuring that web applications remain functional regardless of the user's network conditions.
